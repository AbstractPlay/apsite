It has been a long time; I thought I'd touch base.

First of all, [Paul (`fritzd` at SDG)](https://github.com/paulvanwamelen) has been helping move this project forward. I am very grateful.

I have been working on the renderer and [just released v0.2.0](https://github.com/AbstractPlay/renderer/releases/tag/v0.2.0). There is still work to do, but it's remarkably close to where it needs to be. There's no "playground" yet, but any interested developer can install the project and use the built-in tester locally. It works just fine. Once things are more stable, I will create a permanent documentation and playground for developers.

Hopefully I'll have another update relatively soon. Thanks for your continued support.
