I've gotten a fair bit done, though there's nothing to see yet. [The renderer library](https://github.com/AbstractPlay/renderer) is well underway. The scaffolding is up and I can render simple images. Now it's time to actually render game boards.

Once it's able to do that, then I'll move on to the actual gameplay front end, which will be more challenging, but that's the last step to being able to actually play games and test things!

I hope everyone's new year is off to a great start. You'll hear from me soon.
