I'm finally back on the development train. I have a few banked days, so I'll keep plugging along.

I made some more progress on the login code. This is one of the more complicated systems, and of course it's essential, so that's why it's taking some time to fully develop. Also, though, front-end web development is hard :) JavaScript is a very, very messy language. I'm dealing with libraries using three different syntax versions that only work because of the magic of Babel polyfills, so my brain hurts more than a little after a session.

See you next month!
