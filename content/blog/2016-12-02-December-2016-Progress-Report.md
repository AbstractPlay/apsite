You'll notice there hasn't been an update in a couple of months. Don't worry. I'm not fading. We're shorthanded at work, so things have been very busy. I've banked a few development days that I hope to use shortly. I'm also taking some time off this month, so I may even be able to do some development then, too. I just wanted to let you know that things are still happening. A colleague of mine is designing a great logo for the new site! I look forward to sharing it with you all.

I hope you all have a wonderful Christmas with lots of family time and gaming!
