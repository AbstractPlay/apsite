July has been a difficult month. Not only has work been extremely busy, we've a number of deaths in the family, which brings with it many family gatherings. As a result, I've had no extra development time.

With the time I've had, I've started beter understanding how [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) work. The front end can communicate with the back end now, and I've settled on [Saga](https://yelouafi.github.io/redux-saga/docs/introduction/index.html) for handling the asynchronous components. User authentication from the front end is almost working. I hope to actually be able to start testing games in a month or two.

Sorry for such a short update this time 'round. Please visit the [Super Duper Games Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/superdupergames) if you have questions or suggestions. See you in another month!
