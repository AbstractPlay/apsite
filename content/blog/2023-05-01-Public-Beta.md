I thought it might never happen, but it's finally here. [It's public beta time!](https://play.abstractplay.com)!

We're very happy with the core functionality, but we'd love some concrete feedback from users on how to make things better. I hope you will [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/7dmx7BwRzg) and let us know if you run into any trouble or have any ideas.

If you have a favourite game you'd like us to add, the best way to suggest it is to come to [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/7dmx7BwRzg) and use the `/suggest` command. And if you run into any troubles with the game or the site in general, you can use the `/report` command.

I want to again thank [Paul (`fritzd` at SDG)](https://github.com/paulvanwamelen) for his help in getting things to this point. I could not have done it without him.

I will accept all challenges (my username is `Perlk√∂nig`). Make time for games!
