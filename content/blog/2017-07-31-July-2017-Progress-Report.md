July was pretty rough personally, but I did manage to get a little development time in. Here's what happened:

- [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) appears to be the future, so I created a new endpoint (`/query`) that will support it. It will actually make writing the front end simpler and less resource intensive. It's only basic support for now, meaning no mutations or authentication, but it works.

- A few other low-level things. Check out the [GitHub repos](https://github.com/AbstractPlay) for details

Slowly but surely! I hope to have some extra time in the fall. I know it must be frustrating for you guys. It must feel like watching paint dry. But things *are* moving forward!
