Things have been moving along at a good clip. [The renderer](https://github.com/AbstractPlay/renderer) is in a very good place. It now works properly in Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Edge, and [a new demo/playground area is now available](https://abstractplay.com/renderer/), if you want to see what it can do.

The [games library](https://github.com/AbstractPlay/gameslib) is also in a stable place now. The following games have been implemented so far:

I have a list of other SDG games to move over at some point. It will be a gradual process. And a nomination process will be instituted once we launch to guide us in what we add next.

We are working diligently on the hardest part, which is the front end, but it *is* coming together. Everything is fully localizable, so people will be able to contribute translations of everything. The game screen lets you explore possible game branches very smoothly. Once we have some minimum stable functionality, we'll be looking to launch an open beta to see how things go. Hopefully sometime next year.

I wish you all the very best this holiday season.
